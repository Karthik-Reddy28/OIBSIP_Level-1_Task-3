🌡️ Task 3 Complete: Temperature Converter Built! 🌡️

Thrilled to announce that I've completed Task 3 of my web development journey—a fully functional temperature converter! 🌐

The converter allows users to input a temperature and instantly switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit with a simple click of the "Convert" button.
🔑 Key features include:

✅ Input validation to ensure the temperature is a valid number.
✅Options to select either Celsius or Fahrenheit as the input unit.
✅Instant temperature conversion at the press of a button.
✅Display of the converted temperature with the correct unit.

I also took on the extra challenge and added a Kelvin conversion option! 🌟
This was a great way to practice UI design, input validation, and interactive functionality.
